      <h2>Let It Be</h2>
      <p>When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me</p>
      <p>Speaking words of wisdom, let it be</p>
      <p>And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me</p>
      <p>Speaking words of wisdom, let it be</p>
      <p>Let it be, let it be</p>
      <p>Let it be, let it be</p>
      <p>Whisper words of wisdom</p>
      <p>Let it be</p>

    <div class="song">
      <h2>Hey Jude</h2>
      <p>Hey Jude, don't make it bad</p>
      <p>Take a sad song and make it better</p>
      <p>Remember to let her into your heart</p>
      <p>Then you can start to make it better</p>
      <p>Hey Jude, don't be afraid</p>
      <p>You were made to go out and get her</p>
      <p>The minute you let her under your skin</p>
      <p>Then you begin to make it better</p>
