//console.log is a form of debugging and
//seeing values of variables and printing them to the console
//use your google inspect to see this
console.log("hello");

//two things happening here.
//1. you are setting a "variable" using var.
//   a variable is used to give an item a value
//   and then use that variable later on in your logic
//2. you are giving the value of that variable a "String"
//   a string is a datatype that is used to combine a set of characters
//   there are a few datatypes that you will become familiar with
//   String is very popular
var firstVar = "hello again";

//you are now logging the "firstVar" variable to the console
//use your google inspect to see this
console.log(firstVar);
