/*
  Rules of the dice game:
  1. Create two players
  2. Both players have three dice.
  3. Whoever rolls the highest sum of the three dice wins.
  4. Play up until 9

  Instructions:
  1. Create two objects representing players:
    - it should have their name
    - the values of their dice
    - amount of wins they have
  2. Also have a variable for:
    - the number of rounds
    - the amount of ties
  3. Create a while loop that will stop when the number of rounds is 9
  4. Inside the while loop:
    - alert the sum of the dice roll for each player
    - alert who won the round or if it was a tie
    - increment either a player one win, player two win, or a tie per round
    - alert the current score of the game
    - reset the values of the player one dice totals, player two dice totals, player One dice values, player two dice values
  5. After the while loop, report who won the game or if it was tied
